# Jupyter Book on O.P.P.

![](images/jbopp_header.png)

The project is called "J-bopp," with that spelling, capitalization,
and punctuation in homage to
[K-pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-pop) and
[J-pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J-pop), which I know almost
nothing of but I liked how the "JB on O.P.P." tagline and acronym were
working out. The repo is called "j-bopp" because only a barbarian
would use capital letters.
